        Burzum's take on Computer Graphics

    <div class="textChunk">
        <p> Hello, beautiful people of the internet! I am Burzum. Today I want to delve into
            how video games, or computers in general, simulate our perception, using technologies such as:
            perspective projections, texture mapping, shading models (like gourard), raytracing and whatnot.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't be intimitated! If you don't have a huge mathematical background, it is fine. I will try to be as
            simple as possible.

        <h> Introduction </h>
        <p>
            The human vision works as follows: light coming from an object is projected on the curvature
            of the back of the eye, and our brain flips it and accounts for the curvature,
            making it flat (mostly). This in fact, is equivalent to perspective projection.

            There are other type of projections, which be later discuessed (WIP).

        </p>

        <p>
            Perspective projection is a type of transformation.
            A transformation is esentially a change done to a point, with a specific geometrical operation in mind.
            For example consider the point: $$P = (2, 3)$$
            We can translate, or move this point to the left: \(P' = (0, 3)\)
            And therefore, we transformed it, we have obtained a point from another by doing something to it, in this case translation.
            <br>
            Perspective projection is esentially the same thing.
            We take a point and transform it so that it is projected on something, in our case it will be a plane.
            But to sake of simplicity, let's start with \(R^2\) (2D).

            A matrix is a 2 dimensional collection of numbers, and is used to transform points.
            For example: $$P = I_2 \cdot P$$
            where \(I_2\) is the 2 dimensional identity matrix:
            $$ I_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
            Why matrices? Your GPU is very good at parallelization. <br>
            Let's say we are multiplying a 3x3 matrix with a 1x3 column matrix, we need 3 entries for the resultant column matrix,
            which are entirely independent of each other. Esentially, we need 3 dot independent products, which is just repetitive addition; relatively simple in terms of computation.
            Another reason is integrity: for every point if we can find a transformation matrix, we will just multiply every point with 
            the same matrix, no questions asked! You can start to understand why it is advantagous to use matrices.
            <br>
            <br>
            Above, you see a homogenous point being transformed via a 3x3 matrix.
            2 dimensional points can't be projectively transformed with 2x2 matrices,
            as projective transformations aren't affine transformations: they don't preserve distances!
            We will use what is called homogenous coordinates.
        </p> 
        <h> Projective geometry </h>
        <p>
            Projective geometry is a very abstract type of geometry that needs rigorous understanding.
            I will absolutely not delve into the details of it, however we will borrow the coordinate system that is associated with it:
            As said, homogenous coordinates. Why not cartesia coordinates? Well, let me repeat; as stated, cartesian coordinates cannot be projectively transformed
            via matrices. But how can homogenous coordinates can be? Let's see.
            A projective plane \( \mathbb{P}^2 \) is a set of equivalence relations defined as follows:
            $$P_0 \sim \lambda \cdot P_1, \ \lambda \ne 0$$
            Which are "points" on that projective plane.
            what does this mean? <br>
            It means, roughly speaking, each projective line (euclidean lines going through the origin) is a "point" on this projective space.
            For some reference, consider the homogenous coordinate \(x\): 
            $$
            P = [1: 1: 2] \equiv [2: 2: 4] \equiv [4: 4: 8]
            $$

            In general:
            $$ [x: y: w] \equiv [\lambda x: \lambda y: \lambda w], \lambda \in F_{\mathbb{P}^2} $$

            And a corresponding cartesian coordinate can be obtained via the operation:

            $$ P_{\mathbb{R}^2} = \bigg(\frac{x}{w}, \frac{y}{w}\bigg)  \equiv [x: y: w] \cdot \frac{1}{w} $$

            Let's say I want to project any point \(P \) onto the line \(x = d \): <br>

            It is not hard to see: 
            $$P' = [d, y_p]^T$$

            Meaning 
            $$P' = \frac{dP}{P_x}, \ P = (P_x, \ P_y)$$

            Looks familiar? &#128515

            $$ P' \equiv [P_x: P_y: \frac{1}{d}P_x] $$
            Augmenting \(P\) to homogenous coordinates:
            $$
            P' = H \cdot P
            $$
            Precisely: 
            $$
            P' = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{d} & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot P
            $$
            where \(H\) is the homography matrix.
