  <h1 class="headline">Computer graphics</h1>
  <p1 class="infobox"> hello! I am Burzum and I wrote what you are about to read. <br>
    The purpose of this writing is to have fun and guide myself towards the journey of writing a solid software renderer
    by myself. </br></p1>

  <p2 class="kinkybox"> The stuff I wrote mostly consists of ramblings of my own and may be the outcries of my passion
    towards computer graphics. It is not to be taken formally!!!! Or reference of any kind...</p2>
  <p3 class="kinkybox"> The writing doesn't have any structure as far as I am concerned and I'll be jumping from concept
    to concept even if completely unrelated...</p3>



  <h2 class="marker"> Rasterization </h2>
  <p1 class="infobox"> What the hell is rasterization?? It is basically (probably not very wisely put) the consequence
    of having raster displays and trying to render things defined in vector graphics format.
    <br> Back in the CRT days vector monitors were once common (?) But we now use raster displays almost all the time,
    that's why we need to rasterize. Anyways rasterization is the process of converting things defined in vector
    graphics into their raster counterpart.
  </p1>


  <h2 class="marker"> Polygon Meshes</h2>
  <p1 class="infobox">
    The most interesting and fun thing about computer graphics, at least for me, is polygon meshes. Don't you love that
    almost anything you see in a 3D video game is a polyhedral that is made of triangles or, and quadrilaterals?
    I sure do! Even without texturing I really like the way they look!!!
    <br> Take a look at this dolphin for example (some of the triangles are shaded): </br>
    <div class="illustrator">
      <img src="../static/img/dolphin.png"> </img>
      <p>Notice that this is a considerably low polygon model, <br> meaning it consists of relatively lower triangles;
        making it look less detailed <br></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    </br>
    Polygon meshes are the most common way of modeling 3D objects, and even though there are alternatives that are
    sometimes preferred to polygon meshes, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs">metaballs</a>. <br> But most of the time we are going to work with polygon meshes
    which have primitives as triangles.
    </br>
    Notice how this concept reduces literally any solid object to a set of triangles or quadrilaterals. The catch is
    that how do we rasterize these models??? They are defined by triangles, quadrilaterals
    and ultimately lines, after all.

  <h2 class="marker"> Human Perception and the Pinhole Camera Model</h2>
  <p1 class="infobox">
    Us hoomans have eyes that have retinas as "projection planes", The light projects on somewhere back in the eye. The
    pinhole camera model emulates this, but without a
    lens. <br> The image is projected on the retina upside down. The distance between where the projected image occurs,
    or in other words the the positions of where lights meet the photoreceptors and the eye is labeled the focal length.
    At a certain point in front of the eye the same image (with the same dimensions [width and height]) actually forms,
    is projected on a let's say imaginary surface; but not upside down! </br>

    <div class="illustrator">
      <img src="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/camera-calibration-focal-point.svg"> </img>
      <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model">The pinhole camera model</a></p>
    </div>

    <br> Thus to emulate human visual perception we are going to work with a hypersurface embedded at a certain location
    in $R^3$, or simply a plane :)))</br>

  </p1>

  <h2 class="marker"> Perspective Projection </h2>
  <p1 class="infobox">
    Our aim now should be to project points onto the plane we discussed about. The plane itself is named the viewport,
    and that is the plane we are going to take reference of when we
    are going to try to rasterize stuff. Our goal is simple (?) it is to project every point that the object contains to
    the viewport. But this is practically impossible for real world objects; because of the simple fact that they
    contain an infinite amount of points, that is why we use polygon meshes,
    to be able to construct real objects with finite vertices, using triangles and quadrilaterals. The more polygons we
    use, the closer the model is to its real counterpart.
    It is like digitalizing objects and that is why I said I really like it! But let's try to project a single point
    onto a plane before any further ado.
  </p1>

  <div class="eq">
    <p> Let $P$ be any point in $R^3$ represented in homogenous coordinates:</p>
    $$
    P = \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    y_1 \\
    z_1 \\
    w_1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    <p> And our viewport $V$: </p>
    $$
    \displaystyle z = a
    $$

    <p> To project this point $P$, defined in homogenous coordinates, onto the surface $V$ (which happen to be our
      viewport), <br> let's define a matrix to manipulate it: </br>
    </p>
    $$
    M_p = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{z_1}{w_1a} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

  </div>

  <p1 class="infobox"> Ta-da! When we multiply this matrix (Looks terribly like the identity matrix I know...) with any
    homogenous coordinate,
    the result will always be on the surface $V$, in the cartesian coordinate system that is. Wait...
    This is the same as multiplying the cartesian form of the point with $\displaystyle \frac{a}{z_1}. . .$ Well, we are
    not done yet with our matrix! So cope on!!!
  </p1>


  <h2 class="marker"> Transformations </h2>
  <p1 class="infobox"> What happens when we rotate our heads, or walk away from an object? Or do we really walk away
    from it? Maybe it walks away from us? (abandonment issues).
    Do they rotate around our heads within a fixed distance or are we the ones who look around?
    The intentions of this virtually non-sensical series of questions is to make you understand that without a reference
    point, change in poition is ambiguous in terms of
    action relation. It can be very well both and, but why should we care? We should care because we are obviously going
    to render, project our points "relative" to the
    position of our camera or observer.
  </p1>

  <p1 class="infobox">
    Now, stop for a second and think of any time when you shook your head, did your head rotate around itself with
    respect to the yaw axis, or did all of the things
    inside your eye space rotated around the point that your head occupies in the opposite angular direction? Seeing a
    pattern here, aren't we?
  </p1>

  <p1 class="infobox">
    If we were emulate these phenomenon by transforming our camera, that is rotating or translating our viewport, this
    would be costly compared to the method
    that is typically used. Tilt our viewport a little and the projecting of a point onto our viewport is no longer as
    simple as multipliying it by a scalar. I think
    you can see where this is going &#x1F916. . . Yes! We are going to transform the points themselves instead! Well, we
    are going to transform each point according to the camera position, rotation and then project
    onto the viewport. Let's roll!
  </p1>

  <div class="eq">
    <p> Let $\vec{C}$ be the position vector of the camera: </p>

    $$ \vec{C} = \langle x_c, y_c, z_c \rangle $$

    <p> And the rotation of the camera in the $x$ and the $y$ axis respectively (ignoring any possible roll for now):
    </p>

    $$\phi_x, \ \phi_y$$

    <p> Our matrix then becomes: </p>
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{x_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & -\frac{y_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{z_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{z_1}{w_1a} \\
    \end{bmatrix} R_x(\phi_x) \cdot R_y(\phi_y)
    $$

    <p> Or more of an extended version: </p>
    $$
    P(x_c, y_c, z_c, \phi_x, \phi_y, w_1) = \
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{x_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & -\frac{y_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{z_c}{w_1} \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{z_1}{w_1a} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \cos\phi_x & -\sin\phi_x & 0 \\
    0 & \sin\phi_x & \cos\phi_x & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\phi_y & 0 & \sin\phi_y & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    -\sin\phi_y & 0 & \cos\phi_y & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
  </div>

  <p1 class="kinkybox">
    Now, I don't hate myself so I wont multiply these matrices here. You can do it yourself by remembering that matrix
    multiplication isn't commutative. You just need to stay consistent with the order of multiplication.
  </p1>




  <h2 class="marker"> Frustrum Culling </h2>
  <p1 class="infobox"> Well, we humans do have eyesight... but can we see everything? Or do we have a view frustrum that
    limits our vision? Neither!
    In real life unlike in the frustrum eye space "model" there is no far plane, meaning thoretically there is no limit
    for how far we would see. But still, our field of view isn't
    360 degrees; but in our model there is no limitation of that. Any point will project on our viewport. So what do we
    do? Relatively simple. We define a frustrum and any point that is outside of that frustrum won't project on
    our viewport and thus won't be rendered. This is called "frustrum culling" or "clipping". This frustrum by
    definition includes two planes that are parallel to each other. One is called the near plane and is our viewport.
    The other is the bigger one and is called the far plane. This plane is specifically important because it limits how
    far we can see.
